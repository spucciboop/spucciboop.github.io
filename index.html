<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<h3>Why GitHub?</h3>
<p>You may ask why I didn't use a diffrent tool besides GitHub for creating websites. Here's why:</p>
<blockquote>
<li>WordPress sucks because its website elements are pretty bloated and sometimes restrict our ability to customise the website. Imagine loading an average WordPress site on an outdated Internet browser using your metered connection. It should've devoured several megabytes of your data plan (each of them weighs ~10MB, probably "not" a big deal).</li>
<li>I'm not someone like <a href="https://www.carolynmackler.com/">Carolyn Mackler</a> who can afford a team of software developers to have her website built so she can advertise her books like a pro.</li>
<li>It allows me to create ultra-minimalistic websites.</li>
<li>You can add billions of different plugins to literally make your website a miniature version of The Times Square.</li>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no idea what a perfect website is. All you have ever seen are skeuomorphic bastardisations of over-designed websites. I've been trying to make the web more accessible, so I'd be grateful to you for being a fan of this design. Minimalistic, lightweight, accessible, and just a little bit better than ARPANET websites, which are not a total eyesore.</p>
