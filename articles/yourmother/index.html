<h3>Pointless greetings</h3>
<p class="regular">Greetings, my name is Beef, and today I would like to present an exceedingly excellent <i>Your Mother</i> joke. I will now begin.</p>
<pclass="regular">To be honest, your biological mother is so <b>morbidly obese</b>.</p>
<h3>Evidences</h3>
<p class="regular">When she went to go get her yearly physical done, the doctor took her blood and the results concluded that she had a high blood pressure, onset type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and the possibility of heart disease. She also suffers from severe depression because she lacks confidence in her physical appearance, which enables her to consume even more food, making her more obese. </p>
<p class="regular">Not to mention, but your mother is becoming so monstrous, she had a hard time fitting through small spaces and exceeding weight limits on practical applications.</p>
<p class="regular">Your mother has an endless cycle of malicious eating habits that only make her health worsen over time.<p>
<h3>Final words</h3>
<p class="regular">I hope whoever has just read this article enjoyed the humorous <i>Your Mother</i> joke. Thank you for your time and have a blessed day.</p>
